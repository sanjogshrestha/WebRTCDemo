Autobahn Libraries
=============
The Autobahn project is maintained by the same people who created the open source Crossbar.io WAMP router.

It provides open-source implementations of the Web Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP) for a range of languages (as well as the industry-standard WebSocket test suite).

WAMP connects components in distributed applications using Publish and Subscribe (PubSub) and routed Remote Procedure Calls (rRPC). It is ideal for distributed, multi-client and server applications such as IoT applications or multi-user database-driven business applications.

Modifications
=============
This repository is meant to be a starting point for exploration with WebRTC on Android. Only configuration based changes will be considered for this repository. The sources for the application and library will not be different from what is available within the WebRTC project. If you have some changes for the library or application that you think are relevant, feel free to test them out with this project, but please contribute to the official [WebRTC repository](https://code.google.com/p/webrtc/) and the changes will be incorporated here.


Updates
==============
We won't make any promises on periodic updates to this repository, but rest assured we interact with WebRTC on a daily basis and if any noteworthy updates become available we will update the project shortly thereafter.
